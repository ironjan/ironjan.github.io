The template _includes/image is based on  https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2014/12/07/including-and-managing-images-in-jekyll.html 
and was adapted to my folder structure.

Usage:

{% include image name="Tallinn_20170122_123559.jpg" caption="Teil der südlichen Stadtmauer" alt="Bild der südlichen Stadtmauer" %}
