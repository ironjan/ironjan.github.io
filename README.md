# Jan's blog

The template _includes/image is based on  https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2014/12/07/including-and-managing-images-in-jekyll.html 
and was adapted to my folder structure.

Usage:

{% include image name="Tallinn_20170122_123559.jpg" caption="Teil der südlichen Stadtmauer" alt="Bild der südlichen Stadtmauer" %}

> Note: sometimes the README has to change because github does not 
> rebuild the page automatically for future posts. I'll take a look at
> http://helentran.com/scheduling-posts some time to fix this.
