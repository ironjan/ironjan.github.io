## Image Template

The template _includes/image is based on  https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2014/12/07/including-and-managing-images-in-jekyll.html 
and was adapted to my folder structure.

Usage:

{% include image name="Tallinn_20170122_123559.jpg" caption="Teil der südlichen Stadtmauer" alt="Bild der südlichen Stadtmauer" %}

> Note: sometimes the README has to change because github does not 
> rebuild the page automatically for future posts. I'll take a look at
> http://helentran.com/scheduling-posts some time to fix this.

## New SCSS files

These need to be imported in css/main.scss

## Useful commands

 * `bundle update` - update dependencies
 * `./serve-with-drafts-and-future.sh` - util script for local testing

## Theme

The theme is based on [hagura](http://webjeda.com/hagura/).
